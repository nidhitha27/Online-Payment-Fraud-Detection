## 🔍 Data Description
- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of various features such as transaction amount, time, location, and user behavior.
- **Target Variable:** A binary classification indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
- Data is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)**.
- Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed for optimal performance.

## 📌 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Execute the Python scripts for training and evaluation:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of **XX%** with an F1-score of **YY%**.
- ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix are used to analyze the model's performance.
